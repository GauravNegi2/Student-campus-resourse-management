The file /smart-campus-resource-management-system/smart-campus-resource-management-system/public/favicon.ico is typically a binary file representing the favicon image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

You can create a simple favicon using an online favicon generator or design one using graphic design software. Once you have the image, save it as favicon.ico in the public directory of your project.
